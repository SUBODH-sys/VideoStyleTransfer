## Artistic Video Style Transfer with Segmentation Guidance
# Overview
This project transforms videos by applying artistic styles (e.g., Monetâ€™s paintings) to specific objects, such as a bear, while preserving the background and ensuring smooth transitions. It combines a U-Net model for object segmentation, a VGG19-based style transfer pipeline, and a Streamlit app for user interaction. Inspired by StyTR-2 ([StyTR-2 Paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2105.14576)) and InST ([InST Paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2211.13203)), it extends image-based style transfer to videos with object-specific styling and temporal consistency, using the DAVIS 2017 dataset ([DAVIS 2017](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/csergi/share/davis/DAVIS-2017-trainval-480p.zip).
